At first, I tried to do everything directly in the terminal, but I got confused with the commands. Then I moved to the Python Playground online IDE, but I couldn't save my progress there without a subscription. I spent a lot of time trying different ways to save and run the code correctly. After a lot of hard work and effort, I finally managed to create this working version with random wishes and colors. It was a long journey, but I did it!
